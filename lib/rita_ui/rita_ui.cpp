// the ui class will contain all the functions to create the user flow 
// for the user.


// User features to be implemented:
// 1. User can see the current state of the device (e.g. last watering, next watering, etc.)
// 2. User can see the state of the ML model and how close it is to consistently watering on target.
// 3. User can update the device targets (target days wet, target days dry, wet threshold?, dry threshold?).
// 4. User can choose to set or update hyperparameters for the ML model.
// 5. User can idle the device where an animation plays and the lcd goes to sleep.
